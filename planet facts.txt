Sun: The Sun is the main star of the Solar system, the closest star to the Earth, everything found in the Solar system is orbiting around it, the whole system’s main part. It’s very far from us so we can't feel the heat from it that much.

Mercury: Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and ever since the Pluto is a dwarf planet, it’s the smallest planet. It’s smaller than the Earth, because of that, some Moons orbiting other planets are bigger than it, It’s not as heavy as the Earth.

Venus: The Venus is the second planet in the Solar system. It’s almost as big and heavy as the Earth, so it’s sometimes named the „twin of the Earth”. It’s orbit is very similar to a perfect circle, it’s the closest planet to the Earth.

Earth: Earth, our home, the 5th biggest planet in the Solar system, looking at it’s statistics, it’s considered the biggest rock planet, but it’s only a little bit bigger than Venus.

Mars: Mars is the 4th planet on the list, this one is the red planet everyone likes to talk about when it comes to aliens. It’s only half the size of the Earth, it's a super light planet, the whole surface of Mars is smaller than all the land on Earth combined.

Jupiter: Jupiter is our 5th stop, it’s the biggest of all the planets in the Solar system. It’s name comes from the Roman god luppiter, but it was discovered way before the romans, and in most of the ancient cultures it was associated with gods or goddesses. it’s weight doesn't really matter because the Sun is always the heaviest, but next to the other planets, it's very heavy.

Saturn: Saturn is the 6th sight to see, it’s a similar giant as Jupiter, the second biggest of all, it’s in the same category of giant planets as Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. It's less heavy than Jupiter, but it’s almost as dense. The only planet that is less dense than water itself.

Uranus: Uranus is the 7th space sphere, the 3rd widest of the so called "gas giants", but it's the lightest. It doesn’t fit in the category of Saturn and Jupiter, it is different from the 2 giants since it has more in common with Neptune. It has a small rock core in the middle.

Neptune: Neptune is the 8th and last planet of our journey, the furthest planet. It's not very wide but it's still up there, and it's the 3rd heaviest giant planet, it’s the „twin” of Uranus, but it’s heavier than it, however it's not as wide. This planet has a solid core made of ice.
